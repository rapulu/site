I'm Paul Rapuluchukwu, I write backend code that adds functionality to everything a front-end engineer creates.

I reside in Lagos, Nigeria. I started my coding journey in 2009, but only started writing code professionally in 2015.

I currently work at Treehill tech solutions as a Backend Engineer, where I build efficient systems and integrations for different local and international clients.

My mostly used languages are Laravel/PHP, Vuejs/Javascript, and Golang, although I only recently started using Golang I have built few personal tools with it.

I also create time to mentor people on [Hng Internship](https://hng.tech/), where I help train the next generation of developers and tech experts, also a member of several developer communities like [ForLoop Africa](https://forloop.africa/), [Laravel Nigeria](https://www.laravelnigeria.com/), [Gophers Nigeria](https://twitter.com/golangnigeria).
