I'm Paul Rapuluchukwu, I write backend code that adds functionality to everything a front-end engineer creates.

I reside in Lagos, Nigeria. I started my coding journey in 2009, but only started writing code professionally in 2015.

I currently work at Treehill tech soluions as a Backend Engineer, where I build efficient systems and integrations for different local and international clients.

My mostly used languages Laravel/PHP, Vuejs/Javascript, and Golang, although I only recently started using Golang I have built few personal tools with it.

I'm a Hng Internship mentor, where i help to mentor and train the next generation of developers and tech experts, also a member of several developer communities like ForLoop Africa, Laravel Nigeria, Gophers Nigeria.
