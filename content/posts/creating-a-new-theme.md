## Introduction

Over the years i have stumbled on some awesome tech blogs while learning something new or updating knowledge on something forgotten, and over the years i tend to forget about them.

What if these awesome tech blogs by some awesome writers were documented somewhere and categorized by stacks so someone can have a place to check and see where others are learning from, this led me to create [Awesome-blogs](https://github.com/rapulu/awesome-blogs).

I would love people to contribute to these repo with their own awesome tech blogs or tech blogs they have stumbled on which was/is a great help to them. You might be helping someone somewhere without knowing.

You don't have to be a programmer/developer to contribute, this good for someone who is looking for where to contribute on github.
